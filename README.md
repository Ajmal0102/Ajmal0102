👋 Hi, I’m @Ajmal0102

👀 I’m interested in all things Java and web development, from back-end to front-end, and everything in between.

🌱 I’m currently learning and keeping up with the latest trends in Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and React.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that involve innovative tech stacks, open-source contributions, or anything that challenges my problem-solving skills.
